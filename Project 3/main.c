/*
 The purpose this lab is to create a program that demonstrates various bitwise
 operations applied to two arbitrary integers.
 The result should be shown in decimal, hexadecimal, and binary.
*/


//What we will include:
//The standard library
#include <stdio.h>

//Defining the pre-declared functions:
void print_dec_hex_binary(unsigned int);

// Define the Global variables:
// It will take in 2 user inputs as unsigned integers
unsigned int a;
unsigned int b;

/*
 void print_dec_hex_binary(unsigned int);

 What this function does is take in an unsigned integer (number) as a parameter
 and it will convert it into a decimal hexadecimal, and a binary
*/
void print_dec_hex_binary(unsigned int number){
    //Prints the Decimal of the number
    printf("\nDecimal: %u\n", number);

    //Prints the hexadecimal conversion of the number
    //%#010x is a buillt-in that I got from
    //http:stackoverflow.com/questions/14733761/printf-formatting-for-hex
    //What it does is format it as hexadecimal.
    //if the integer entered is 9, it will convert it to 0x00000008
    printf("Hexadecimal: ");
